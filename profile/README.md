# Welcome :wave:

This is the GitHub organization for the [University of Michigan Solar Car Team](https://www.solarcar.engin.umich.edu) :smile:. You can find the code that powers our firmware :computer:, physics tools :wrench:, and ouija board :ghost: all in this organization.

Want to create software or store data? Head over to the [styles and standards](https://github.com/MichiganSolarCarTeam/style-and-standards) repository to get started. :sun_with_face:

By the way, if you're from another solar car team (Delft, Twente, Tokai, Sonnenwagen, Innoptus, TopDutch, Illinois, MIT, Stanford, etc.), [it's recommended that you click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0). :wink:

Happy solar raycing! :trophy:
