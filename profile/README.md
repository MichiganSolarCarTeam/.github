# Hi there :wave:

This is the GitHub organization for the University of Michigan Solar Car Team :smile:. You can find the code that powers our firmware, physics tools, and ouija board all in this organization.

Want to create software or store data? Head over to the [styles and standards](https://github.com/MichiganSolarCarTeam/style-and-standards) repository to get started.

By the way, if you're from another solar car team (TU Delft, Twente, Tokai, Sonnenwagen, Innoptus, MIT, Stanford, Illinois), [it's recommended that you click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0).
